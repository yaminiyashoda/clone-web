							<h2>Call for Grand Challenge Proposals</h2>
						</header>
						<section class="text-justify">
							<p>The IEEE International Conference on Multimedia & Expo (ICME) has been the flagship
								multimedia conference sponsored by four IEEE societies since 2000. It serves as a forum
								to promote the exchange of the latest advances in multimedia technologies, systems, and
								applications from both the research and development perspectives of the circuits and
								systems, communications, computer, and signal processing communities.</p>

							<p>The organization of grand challenges for IEEE ICME 2022 is significantly revamped to
								better facilitate participation and impact. Please see the following guidelines for this
								year’s grand challenge (GC) CfP:</p>
							<ol>
								<li>GC organizers cannot participate as competitors in the GC they are organizing.</li>
								<li>GC organizers should provide a dataset that is open for competition, in particular:
									i) a training set with ground truth that is available to all participants, and ii) a
									testing set that is also available to participants, but whose ground truth is
									hidden. GC organizers are responsible for evaluating all submitted models using the
									testing set (plus, optionally, a second testing set that is hidden to the
									participants).</li>
								<li>GC organizers should coordinate reviews of GC papers that describe their submitted
									models. Submitted GC papers can optionally have missing results section, which will
									be completed after GC organizers have completed their evaluations. GC papers have
									the same camera-ready deadline as regular papers, but a much tighter review cycle.
									GC paper submission deadline should coincide with the model submission deadline for
									GCs. Similarly, GC paper acceptance announcement should coincide with the model
									evaluation results announcement. See below listed dates for details. This gives
									participants the maximal amount of time to prepare their models for submission to GC
									organizers for evaluation.</li>
								<li>GC organizers should organize accepted GC papers into their own 2-hour GC session in
									the ICME’22 program, which should include GC paper presentations (oral or poster),
									followed by a panel or open discussion. Winners of competitions should be announced
									during the GC sessions.</li>
								<li>Based on the quality of the accepted GC papers, GC organizers can subsequently
									submit a proposal for inclusion in special section of IEEE Transactions on
									Multimedia via expedited reviews. Further, GC organizers can submit renewal of
									successfully coordinated GC for the following ICME rendition.</li>
							</ol>
