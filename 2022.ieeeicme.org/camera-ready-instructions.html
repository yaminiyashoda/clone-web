							<p>To prepare your paper for submission to ICME 2022, please refer to the <a
									href="#_General-Information">General Information</a> first, and also read carefully
								the information for the specific program.</p>
							<p>ICME 2022 contains several different programs:</p>
							<ul>
								<li><a href="#_Regular-and-Special-Sessions">Regular and Special Sessions</a></li>
								<li><a href="#_Workshops">Workshops</a></li>

						<section id="_General-Information" class="mb-0 text-justify">
							<h3>General Information</h3>

							<p>
								All papers in the proceedings of the regular program and proceedings of the workshops
								(including Industry/Application Papers, Demo Track and Grand Challenges) will be
								included in IEEE Xplore.
							</p>

							<h4>Formatting Requirements</h4>
							<ul>
								<li>All submissions must be in English.</li>
								<li>All submissions must be in letter-sized PDF.</li>
								<li>All fonts and subsets must be embedded. Times New Roman font is strongly encouraged.
								</li>
								<li>All submissions must be formatted according to the instructions in the Example
									Paper.</li>
							</ul>

							<h4>Authors Rights and Responsibilities</h4>
							<ul>
								<li>
									<b>Dual submissions</b>: By submitting a manuscript to ICME, the authors guarantee
									that it has not been previously published (or accepted for publication) in
									substantially similar form. Furthermore, no paper that contains significant overlap
									with the contributions of this paper either has been or will be submitted during the
									ICME 2022 review period to either a journal or a conference.
								</li>
								<li>
									More about related IEEE policies (e.g. on author posting of IEEE copyrighted papers,
									plagiarism, originality of submitted work) can be found on IEEE website.
								</li>
								<li>
									<b>Creating your paper</b>: For your submission use the template available below.
									Additional recommendations for various specific parts of IEEE papers are available
									from IEEE’s Author Centre. Please note that when you cite references, papers that
									have not been published, even if they have been submitted for publication, should be
									cited as “unpublished”. Papers that have been accepted for publication should be
									cited as “in press”. IEEE’s Author Centre also includes further guideline on
									policies related to posting of your papers. For example, prior to submission to an
									IEEE publication the authors may post their article on repositories such as
									arXiv.org. <b>This does not count as a prior publication</b>.
								</li>
								<li>
									<b>Presentation guarantee</b>: By submitting the paper, the authors guarantee that
									if the paper is accepted, it will be presented at the conference by one of the
									authors, except in case of emergency as determined by the Technical Co-Chairs.
									Furthermore, the presenter must register for the conference at one of the
									non-student rates offered and must register before the deadline given for author
									registration. Failure to register before the deadline will result in automatic
									withdrawal of your paper from the conference proceedings and program. Failure to
									present the paper by an author in person will result in the paper not appearing in
									IEEE Xplore, and IEEE will retain the copyright. Also, the list of missing authors
									will be passed to the ICME Steering Committee.

							<h3>Regular and Special Sessions</h3>

							<p>Regular and Special Session papers form the core of the ICME technical program.</p>
							<ul class="mb-3">
								<li><b>Camera-ready submission portal</b>: <a
										href="https://cmt3.research.microsoft.com/ICME2022" target="_blank">https://cmt3.research.microsoft.com/ICME2022</a>
								</li>
								<li><b>Length</b>: Papers must be no longer than 6 pages, including all text, figures,
									and references.</li>
								<li><b>Abstract</b>: The abstract should be about 100-150 words.</li>
								<li>
									<b>Supplemental material</b>: Authors may optionally upload supplemental material.
									<br>
									Typically, supplemental material might include:
									<ol class="mt-1 mb-0">
										<li>a short presentation summarizing the paper,</li>
										<li>videos of results that cannot be included in the main paper,</li>
										<li>a screen recording of a demo program,</li>
										<li>related submissions to other conferences and journals, and</li>
										<li>appendices or technical reports containing extended proofs and mathematical
											derivations that are not essential for understanding the paper.</li>
									</ol>

								<li>
									If you have any further question, please contact the Publication Chair on <a
										href="mailto:sallylin0121@saturn.yzu.edu.tw">sallylin0121@saturn.yzu.edu.tw</a>
								</li>
							</ul>
							<p>
								<span class="badge bg-warning text-dark">!</span> All supplemental material must be
								zipped into a single file. There is a 20 MB limit on the size of this file.
							</p>

							<h4>Example Paper, Formatting Guidelines, and Templates</h4>
							<p>
								The following links point to an example paper containing detailed formatting guidelines.
								They also constitute templates for Microsoft Word and LaTeX submissions.
							</p>
							<ul class="mb-3">
								<li>Example paper with detailed formatting instructions and <a
										href="assets/templates/MSWord_template_ICME2022.docx">Microsoft
										Word</a> template.</li>
								<li>Example paper with detailed instructions and <a
										href="assets/templates/latex_template_ICME2022.zip">LaTeX</a>
									template.</li>
							</ul>
							<p>
								We recommend that you use the provided Word file or LaTeX files to produce your
								document, since they have been set up to meet the formatting guidelines detailed in the
								example paper. When using these files, double-check the paper size in your page setup to
								make sure you are using the letter-size paper layout (8.5 inch x 11 inch). The LaTeX
								environment files specify suitable margins, page layout, text, and a bibliography style.
							</p>
							<p>
								In particular, with LaTeX, there are cases where the top-margin of the resulting
								Postscript or PDF file does not meet the specified parameters. In this case, you may
								need to add a \topmargin=0mm command just after the \begin{document} command in your
								.tex file. The spacing of the top margin is not critical, as the page contents will be
								adjusted on the proceedings. The critical dimensions are the actual width and height of
								the page content.
							</p>

							<h4>Electronic Paper Submission</h4>
							<p>
								When you have your document file ready, gather the following information before entering
								the submission system:
							</p>
							<ul class="mb-3">
								<li>Proof-read document file in PDF format with the appropriate copyright clearance code
									notice inserted at the bottom of the first page (see below).</li>
								<li>Supplemental material, if any, zipped into a single file, under 20 MB.</li>
								<li>Affiliation, email address, and mailing address for each author.</li>
								<li>Paper title.</li>
								<li>Text file containing paper abstract text, in ASCII text format (for copying and
									pasting into web page form), 100-150 words.</li>
							</ul>
							<p>
								<span class="badge bg-danger text-uppercase">Important</span> ALL authors must be
								entered in the online form and must appear in the online form in the right order. It is
								not allowed to change authors or title at the Camera Ready stage.
							</p>

							<h4>Step by Step Instructions to Submit Your Paper</h4>
							<p>
								Please notice that the CMT system does not automatically notify paper submissions via
								email. You will not receive a notification unless you enable this manually. Instructions
								on how to enable email notifications for the corresponding author or for all authors are
								below.
							</p>
							<ol class="mb-3">
